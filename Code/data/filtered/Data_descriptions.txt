ordered_data.csv	$the data has only been labeled and faulty columns were removed$
the data set has been labeled with columns names on the first row
the naming scheme of the columns is as follows: 
#number of band#_Band_#name of statistic# for all Rhythem data points
#number of class#_Class_#name of statistic# for all Chroma data points
#number of coefficient#_Coefficient_#name of statistic# for all MFCCs data points
the faulty columns in MFCCs coefficient 1-4 means which were 1000000 were changed to 1E-6
to import the data the following code can be used
train_data = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/ordered_data.csv',index_col=0)[:,:-1]
train_labels = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/ordered_data.csv',index_col=0)[:,-1]
test_data = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/ordered_test_data.csv',index_col=0)


selected_data.csv	$Best dataset so far$
the data set has been labeled with columns names on the first row
the columns have been selected down to only the following statistics: mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, standard deviation
the naming scheme of the columns is as follows: 
#number of band#_Band_#name of statistic# for all Rhythem data points
#number of class#_Class_#name of statistic# for all Chroma data points
#number of coefficient#_Coefficient_#name of statistic# for all MFCCs data points
the faulty columns in MFCCs coefficient 1-4 means which were 1000000 were changed to 1E-6
to import the data the following code can be used
train_data = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/selected_data.csv',index_col=0)[:,:-1]
train_labels = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/selected_data.csv',index_col=0)[:,-1]
test_data = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/selected_test.csv',index_col=0)


filtered_data.csv	$very small dataset but not working well$
the data set has been labeled with columns names on the first row
a random sample was chose from each genre to have matching batch sizes for each genre
the naming scheme of the columns is as follows: 
#number of band#_Band_#name of statistic# for all Rhythem data points
#number of class#_Class_#name of statistic# for all Chroma data points
#number of coefficient#_Coefficient_#name of statistic# for all MFCCs data points
the faulty columns in MFCCs coefficient 1-4 means which were 1000000 were changed to 1E-6
to import the data the following code can be used
train_data = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/filtered_data.csv',index_col=0)[:,:-1]
train_labels = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/filtered_data.csv',index_col=0)[:,-1]
test_data = pd.read_csv('data/filtered/ordered_test_data.csv',index_col=0)
